bind9-snmp 1.8 Release (TO BE ANNOUNCED)
	Misc changes
	  * Patch by Chris Gianelloni:
	    + Add support for dropped stats to the totals and per-domain stats.
	      New tables b9stCounterDuplicate and b9stCounterDropped.
	    + Changed some DESCRIPTION texts to more obvious ones in the schema.
	    + Closes bug #331

bind9-snmp 1.7 Release (Aug 23 2007)
	Bug fixes
	  + Remove global %CFG definition. It overwrote the one in the library!
	  + To support the view information, the %DOMAINS array needed to be completley
	    rewritten/-arranged. It is now in the form 'DOMAINS{domain}{view}{type}'
	    instead of 'DOMAINS{cnt}{type}'. This means that all print functions needed
	    to be updated/rewritten with this in mind.
	    - Add the function print_b9stCounterTypeView() (and wrapper function
	      print_b9stCounterView()) which takes care of outputting the (new)
	      .1.3.6.1.4.1.8767.2.1.4.1.9.* OID.
	      NOTE: Require the v1.17 (200602230927) Bayour.COM MIB!
	    Closes: #290
	  + Rename a couple of variables in the load_information() function to better
	    reflect it's use. The function is difficiult enough to read after a couple
	    of months away from it :).
	    - The default view (if there IS no views!) is '' (NULL).
	  + The get_config() have been changed - first param is config file, the second
	    is what key to reload (missed the config file option).
	  + Recreate the stats file by zeroing out the file instead of remove/touch it.

	Misc changes
	  + Debug cleanup (include 'b9st*Entry' info in debug output).
	  + Bind9 setup and how to test functionality documentation added.
	  + Catch 'rndc' messages and send to log file.

bind9-snmp 1.6 Release (Feb  7 2006)
	Bug fixes
	Misc changes
	  + Document the need to make sure the MIB is the correct version.
	  + Remove some functions that are used in ALL my SNMP modules to a separate
	    perl library (../BayourCOM_SNMP.pm).

bind9-snmp 1.5 Release (Jan 16 2006)
	Bug fixes
	  + Rewrite the note/documentation about the config file. More and better info.
	  + Move IGNORE_INDEX to config file. Default to '1' when loading config file if
	    not present in config file...
	    - Missalignment of IGNORE_INDEX and the no_value(index) stuff.
	  + More debugging added
	  + Only try to open/close the delta file if we should/have dumped the stats.
	    This is not done if we specify a specific file (for example a dump from a
	    'customer' etc).
	  + Don't decrease the domains counter after loading the stats file. The counter
	    starts at zero, goes through all domains and then increase the variable
	    with one. This leads to a 'human' correct value (domains 0-30 => 31 domains,
	    NOT 30!).
	  + Implement some additional checks for IGNORE_INDEX.
	    - If we're at OID_BASE.2 and we 'getnext', we should get "b9stCounterName",
	      not "b9stTotalsIndex" if IGNORE_INDEX is set.

bind9-snmp 1.4 Release (Nov 30 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Completley disble the output of the Index branches. They should be
	    'invisable' so they don't interfere with the table(s).
	  + Remove the Index stuff from the Cacti template files.
	  + Put all (?) configurable stuff in a config file - default location /etc/bind/.bindsnmp.
	    - Including the DEBUG option. It is re-read for every cycle of the 'get input
	      from STDIN' loop.
	  + The MIBDIRS check I did to check if running from shell or SNMPd was flawed.
	    'Only' worked for Debian GNU/Linux. Instead set the OID to correct/real
	    value when we go into the 'get input from STDIN' loop. Sure sign of running
	    through the SNMP.
	  + Missing help() function (referenced, but didn't exist) added.
	  + Selectable at 'compile time' if to ignore Index(es) or not. Used only (!)
	    for debugging!

bind9-snmp 1.3c Release (Nov  1 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Change the 'OID_BASE.[34].1.x' from counter32 to integer32. Missundestood
	    the meaning with Counter32's...

bind9-snmp 1.3b Release (Oct 27 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Missed to enable the "Associated RRA's" for the domains data query in the
	    Cacti template/import file.

bind9-snmp 1.3 Release (Oct 27 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Instead of having two (broken - missing dependencies etc) Cacti template
	    files, use ONE which creates a host template with the two queries (+ two
	    graph templates) and all dependencies etc.

bind9-snmp 1.2 Release (Oct 20 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Missing hard-return in a graph item.
	  + Cleanup the 'process args and get next OID/value'. Can now do bulk queries.

	Misc changes
	  + Moved/renamed the CVS repository (s/snmp/bind9-snmp) because of a freshmeat
	    announcement.
	  + More verbose explanation in README.txt.
	  + Rewrite as a persistent pass-through instead of a 'simple' pass-through.
	    In practise this means that the script will stay running (for a couple of
	    minutes, determined by the snmpd) instead of closing every time. This lead
	    to HUGE speed increases and statistic stability. The script dumps the
	    information _every time it starts_, which meant that in the previous way
	    of running, a full walk of the MIB tree required HUNDREDS (depending on
	    number of domains naturally) of information dumps!!!
	  + Fix so that the script can be running with debugging even on a live system
	    (ie, from the SNMP system).
	    - Quite extensive debug output cleanup was also done in the process.
	  + Move around some function for ease of readability.
	  + To avoid the bind9 information logfile to grow to humongus sizes, remove
	    it (and the delta file) after each dump.

bind9-snmp 1.1 Release (Apr 13 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Include 'Counter32' not 'Counter'.
	  + All Graph items should be using GPRINT Type=Exact numbers...

	Misc changes
	  + The 'b9stTable' was only for total numbers. I'd like information based on
	    the domain name as well.
	    - Rename of 'b9stTable' to 'b9stTotalsTable'.
	    - This affected the whole MIB (b9stNumber, b9stEntry etc etc).
	    - Added the 'b9stDomainsTable' and all it's object types.
	    - Renamed 'b9stGeneralInformationGroup' to 'b9stGroupTotals' and added the
	      'b9stGroupDomains' with the domains table object types.
