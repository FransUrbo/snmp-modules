bind9-snmp 1.1 Release (Apr 13 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Include 'Counter32' not 'Counter'.
	  + All Graph items should be using GPRINT Type=Exact numbers...

	Misc changes
	  + The 'b9stTable' was only for total numbers. I'd like information based on
	    the domain name as well.
	    - Rename of 'b9stTable' to 'b9stTotalsTable'.
	    - This affected the whole MIB (b9stNumber, b9stEntry etc etc).
	    - Added the 'b9stDomainsTable' and all it's object types.
	    - Renamed 'b9stGeneralInformationGroup' to 'b9stGroupTotals' and added the
	      'b9stGroupDomains' with the domains table object types.
