bind9-snmp 1.4 TO BE ANNOUNCED
	Bug fixes
	  + Completley disble the output of the Index branches. They should be
	    'invisable' so they don't interfere with the table(s).
	  + Remove the Index stuff from the Cacti template files.

bind9-snmp 1.3c Release (Nov  1 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Change the 'OID_BASE.[34].1.x' from counter32 to integer32. Missundestood
	    the meaning with Counter32's...

bind9-snmp 1.3b Release (Oct 27 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Missed to enable the "Associated RRA's" for the domains data query in the
	    Cacti template/import file.

bind9-snmp 1.3 Release (Oct 27 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Instead of having two (broken - missing dependencies etc) Cacti template
	    files, use ONE which creates a host template with the two queries (+ two
	    graph templates) and all dependencies etc.

bind9-snmp 1.2 Release (Oct 20 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Missing hard-return in a graph item.
	  + Cleanup the 'process args and get next OID/value'. Can now do bulk queries.

	Misc changes
	  + Moved/renamed the CVS repository (s/snmp/bind9-snmp) because of a freshmeat
	    announcement.
	  + More verbose explanation in README.txt.
	  + Rewrite as a persistent pass-through instead of a 'simple' pass-through.
	    In practise this means that the script will stay running (for a couple of
	    minutes, determined by the snmpd) instead of closing every time. This lead
	    to HUGE speed increases and statistic stability. The script dumps the
	    information _every time it starts_, which meant that in the previous way
	    of running, a full walk of the MIB tree required HUNDREDS (depending on
	    number of domains naturally) of information dumps!!!
	  + Fix so that the script can be running with debugging even on a live system
	    (ie, from the SNMP system).
	    - Quite extensive debug output cleanup was also done in the process.
	  + Move around some function for ease of readability.
	  + To avoid the bind9 information logfile to grow to humongus sizes, remove
	    it (and the delta file) after each dump.

bind9-snmp 1.1 Release (Apr 13 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Include 'Counter32' not 'Counter'.
	  + All Graph items should be using GPRINT Type=Exact numbers...

	Misc changes
	  + The 'b9stTable' was only for total numbers. I'd like information based on
	    the domain name as well.
	    - Rename of 'b9stTable' to 'b9stTotalsTable'.
	    - This affected the whole MIB (b9stNumber, b9stEntry etc etc).
	    - Added the 'b9stDomainsTable' and all it's object types.
	    - Renamed 'b9stGeneralInformationGroup' to 'b9stGroupTotals' and added the
	      'b9stGroupDomains' with the domains table object types.
