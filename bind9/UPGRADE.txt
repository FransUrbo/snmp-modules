If upgrading from 1.1:
* The script is now a pass-through PERSISTS instead of a
  simple pass-through. This because I noticed that SNMPd
  calls the script ONCE FOR EACH OID requested. For a walk,
  that's a lot of calls!
  Every time the script is/was called, it dumped the Bind9
  statistics, THEN processed and returned the information...
  Lead to a LOT of dumping of statistics!

  Instead use a 'pass_persist' in the snmpd.conf file, so
  that the script is called only ONCE. The SNMPd will kill
  the script if not used 'for a couple of minutes'. Don't
  know how long, but IF the script is keept running for
  more than five minutes, it will issue a reload/redump
  of the Bind9 statistics by itself...
* The script now removes the information dump file (dns-stats.log)
  after each dump. This to keep the file in reasonable sizes.
  The file grows with a couple of kilobytes _every five minutes_
  and over time (not MUCH time!), it's over 2Gb in size!
