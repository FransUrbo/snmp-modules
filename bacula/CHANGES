bacula-snmp 1.2 Release (Oct 21 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Convert some values that's to big to fit in a
	    Counter32. From BYTES to KILO bytes...
	    - Fixed the 'Wrong Type' error messages.
	  + Rewrite the baculaStatsTable indexing. Now works.

	Misc changes
	  + Inset a new table (baculaStatsCountersTable) that
	    contain the counter names instead of having them
	    in the baculaStatsTable.
	    - They messed up the baculaStatsTable...
	  + Include more information (type, status, level,
	    errors and missing files) in the stats table.
