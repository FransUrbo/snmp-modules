bacula-snmp 1.2 
	Bug fixes
	  * When getting the status index, increase tmp[4], NOT tmp[2] (which is the
	    status INFORMATION). Fixed problems with the status column not being shown
	    correctly.
	  * Rewrite/fix the Cacti XML template file:
	    - Replace my 'placeholder'/'shortcut' for the base OID with the real OID
	      in the Cacti XML template file.
	    - Change/fix the OID 'path' to the index in the Cacti XML template file.
	    - Only the OUTPUT values (the actual statistics OIDs) should be put in the
	      'index_order' tag.
	    - Add the miscellaneous information (such as client uname, client autoprune
	      etc, etc). Just for the sake of it!
	    - Include index (and value OIDs) for the job names, job IDs. This because
	      the stats table depend on the client, jobname and jobID tables...
	    - Add the 'Data Queries->Associated Graph Templates' values.
	    - Add the job errors value to the 'Data Template' section.

	Misc changes
	  * Possibility to retreive one specific config option in the get_config()
	    function. I wanted to be able to re-get the DEBUG value every time in
	    the main 'process args and get next OID' loop...
	  * The DEBUG_BACULA environment variable overrides any DEBUG option in the
	    config file.
	  * Some cleanup regarding log output. Don't want to much (but not to little
	    either) when running in debug mode 2 or 3. The SQL status loading is
	    only shown if DEBUG > 4 (not DEBUG >= 4).

bacula-snmp 1.2 Release (Oct 21 2005)
	Bug fixes
	  + Convert some values that's to big to fit in a
	    Counter32. From BYTES to KILO bytes...
	    - Fixed the 'Wrong Type' error messages.
	  + Rewrite the baculaStatsTable indexing. Now works.

	Misc changes
	  + Inset a new table (baculaStatsCountersTable) that
	    contain the counter names instead of having them
	    in the baculaStatsTable.
	    - They messed up the baculaStatsTable...
	  + Include more information (type, status, level,
	    errors and missing files) in the stats table.
